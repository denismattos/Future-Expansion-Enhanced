<h2>Some suggestions to improve unit upgrades.</h2>

Since I'm attempting to fix v4.1's compatibility with newer versions of Unciv, thought I'd suggest some unit upgrade changes I believe make sense.  
Mostly completing military units' upgrade trees, as Future Expansion already does, in some cases.
