<h2>Some suggestions to improve units.</h2>

Since I'm attempting to fix v4.1's compatibility with newer versions of Unciv, thought I'd suggest some unit improvements.

Mostly completing military units' upgrade trees – as Future Expansion already does, in some cases – with connections I believe make sense.

Also, I'm gonna try to replace non-plane flying and hovering units' uniques with the one Unciv newly implemented, allowing units to move over water without embarking.
