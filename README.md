# Future Expansion ‚Äì Enhanced
My own modifications to Sullien's [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/Sullien) great ‚Äì and, now, defunct ‚Äì [Future Expansion](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion) for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

## Dependencies
This customization is based on and requires [Future Expansion Continued](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued), my continuation of Sullien's mod.  
As such, it is intended for use with the Gods & Kings ruleset.

## WiP Warning
**This mod is still a WiP and limited by my currently restricted knowledge of Unciv and the original expansion mod.  
I can't guarantee its stability or usability in-game.  
I'll do my best to address any received feedback.  
Thanks in advance for your patience, tolerance and interest. üôèüèª**

## Ownership Disclaimer
Inspired by the awesome Mlie [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/emipa606). üôÇ

* This is a modification of an existing mod.
* I claim no ownership of the original mod.
* The original author is free to use this mod to update their own.
* Since I did not create the original mod, I will not accept donations for this mod of a mod.

## Future Plans
I intend to add much more to this mod-of-a-mod than simply customizations of the original content, although I'm not done with that, yet.  
After a lot of playtesting, I'd designed a partial restructuring of the specialized, mutually-excluding resource hubs. However, I've since lost access to the HDD I had this on. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
I'll get back to it ASAI've regained access to my old HDD or I've played enough to recreate what I'd done ‚Äì whichever comes first.

Now, for my other ideas:  
Some of them come from the great [Future Worlds mod for Civ V](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596919865) (which I'd wager was one of Sullien's inspirations), some from other Civ V mods, some from Sullien's own [unreleased next version of Future Expansion](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Unreleased), some from interesting ideas in sci-fi and futurism and some from my own ideas while playing the game.  
What I've thought up, so far:
* Buildings:
   * Other energy plants, including Tidal and Geothermal Plants.
   * Battery Bank.
   * Genetic Bank.
   * Gen-Editing Facility.
   * Space Beacon.
   * Central Mainframe.
   * Geodesical Garden.
   * Vertical Farm.
   * Myco-Tank.
   * Protein Vat.
   * Several buildings from Sullien's unreleased next version, including Faculties and Breakthroughs.
* Improvements:
   * Maglev Rails.
   * Living Fortresses.
   * Deep Mines.
   * Nature Preserves.
   * Hamlets.
   * Villages.
   * Towns.
   * Suburbs.

   * Worker Bots.
   * Coast Guard.
   * Snipers.

   * Stealth Destroyers and Stealth Battleships.
   * More genetically-engineered creatures, including Stealth Seekers (cat-like Seekers), Seeker Drones (bird-like Seekers), dinosaurs, ambulant fungi, dragons and other pseudo-mythical creatures and maybe more.
   * Zombie Mutants.
   * Super Soldiers.
   * Orbital Drones.
   * Make Orbital Strikes a Unit Type, including Orbital Shots, Orbital Lasers, Convergence Deathrays, Stellaser Strikes and Void Bombs.
   * Other aliens, including Xenomorphs, Yautja (predators), Saya-jins, Namekusei-jins, Zergs, Arachnids (from Starship Troopers), Green Martians (from the Barsoom novels), Skrulls, Gauna, Krogans, Daleks, Cylons, Sith Lords, Borgs and maybe more.
* National Wonders:
   * Super Mainframe.
   * Megabattery
   * Underground Colony.
   * Space Stations, including Earth's orbit, Earth-Moon Lagrangian points, Sun-Earth Lagrangian points and maybe more.
   * Arcology.

   * Borehole.
   * The Eye in the Sky.
   * Humanity Vault.
   * Space Ark.
   * Space Elevator.
   * Generational Spaceship.
   * Space Colonies, including the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Ceres, Europa, Io, Ganymede, Callisto, Pluto and maybe more.
   * Bishop Ring.
   * Space Missions with varied destinies, including Ringworld, Rama, a Dyson sphere, Alpha Centauri, V'Ger, a wormhole, a neutron star, a blackhole's event horizon and maybe more.
   * Space Drive.
   * First Contacts, including Vulcans, Asogians, Minbari, Protoss, Asari and maybe more.
   * Death Star.
   * Artificial Sun.
   * Artificial Black Hole.
   * Artificial Wormhole.

I plan on holding polls on Discord to decide on what to work next.  
Keep in mind some of these ideas depend on as-of-yet unavailable modding features (But, hey, we can dream, right? üòâ).

I'm, also, very much open to suggestions! üôÇ
