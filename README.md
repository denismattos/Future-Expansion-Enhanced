# Future Expansion ‚Äì Enhanced
My own modifications to Sullien's [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/Sullien) great ‚Äì and, now, defunct ‚Äì [Future Expansion](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion) for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

## Dependencies
This customization is based on and requires [Future Expansion Continued](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued), my continuation of Sullien's mod.  
As such, it is intended for use with the Gods & Kings ruleset.

## WiP Warning
**This mod is still a WiP and limited by my currently restricted knowledge of Unciv, the original expansion mod and even JS in general.  
I can't guarantee its stability or usability in-game.  
I'll do my best to address any received feedback.  
Thanks in advance for your patience, tolerance and interest. üôèüèª**
