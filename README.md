# Future Expansion – Enhanced

My own modifications to Sullien's [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/Sullien) great – and, now, defunct – [Future Expansion](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion) for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

## Dependencies

This customization is based on and requires [Future Expansion Continued](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued), my continuation of Sullien's mod.  
As such, it is intended for use with the Gods & Kings ruleset.

## WiP Warning

**This mod is still a WiP and limited by my currently restricted knowledge of Unciv and the original expansion mod.  
I can't guarantee its stability or usability in-game.  
I'll do my best to address any received feedback.  
Thanks in advance for your patience, tolerance and interest. 🙏🏻**

## Ownership Disclaimer

Inspired by the awesome Mlie [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/emipa606). 🙂

- This is a modification of an existing mod.
- I claim no ownership of the original mod.
- The original author is free to use this mod to update their own.
- Since I did not create the original mod, I will not accept donations for this mod of a mod.

## Future Plans

I intend to add much more to this mod-of-a-mod than simply customizations of the original content, although I'm not done with that, yet.  
After a lot of playtesting, I'd designed a partial restructuring of the specialized, mutually-excluding resource hubs. However, I've since lost access to the HDD I had this on. 🤦‍♂️  
I'll get back to it ASAI've regained access to my old HDD or I've played enough to recreate what I'd done – whichever comes first.

Now, for my other ideas:  
Some of them come from the great [Future Worlds mod for Civ V](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596919865) (which I'd wager was one of Sullien's inspirations), some from other Civ V mods, some from Sullien's own [unreleased next version of Future Expansion](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Unreleased), some from interesting ideas in sci-fi and futurism and some from my own ideas while playing the game.  
What I've thought up, so far:

- Buildings:
  - ~~Nature Preserve.~~
  - Other energy plants, including Tidal and Geothermal Plants.
  - Battery Bank.
  - Genetic Bank.
  - Gen-Editing Facility.

  - Space Drive.
  - First Contacts, including Vulcans, Asogians, Minbari, Protoss, Asari and maybe more.
  - Death Star.
  - Artificial Sun.
  - Artificial Black Hole.
  - Artificial Wormhole.

I plan on holding polls on Discord to decide on what to work next.  
Keep in mind some of these ideas depend on as-of-yet unavailable modding features (But, hey, we can dream, right? 😉).

I'm, also, very much open to suggestions! 🙂

## Changelog

### 1.0.6

#### [Foreword](/docs/forewords.md#106)

- Implemented some units from [Sullien's unreleased future plans for the mod](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Unreleased):
  - Heavy Worker, a more efficient worker of later eras. (Architect is now a later, optional upgrade for Workers.)
  - Worker Bot (Slower movement than Heavy Workers, but cheaper. Only available after adopting Technocracy.)
- Introduced the Coast Guard, a melee water unit specialized in patrolling coastal tiles and repelling Barbarians.
- Barbarians' gained an equivalent in the Attack Dinghy, a cheap and powerful melee water craft, specialized in harassing coastal tiles.

- Fixed unit upgrade trees' progression, that I'd unintentionally broken.
