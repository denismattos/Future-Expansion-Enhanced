## 1.0.6
I recently learned that, due to the way the game works, [my modifications to unit upgrade trees break progression](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/664739473367760908/1355042625237024788), as a unit is not allowed to "skip" an upgrade, thus making any upgrades after a missable unit type permanently locked. (Thanks, Lodo! [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/46xAeu5.png">](https://discordapp.com/users/lodothebear) [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken) ðŸ™‚)  
I changed how it works based on chenxing61's [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/46xAeu5.png">](https://discordapp.com/users/chenxing61) [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/chenxing61) [suggestion](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/664739473367760908/1355050239127715952). Thanks, chenxing! ðŸ™‚

As [the game has been modified in the past based on a suggestion I made](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued/blob/main/docs/forewords.md#417), I've also opened [a ticket to suggest units be allowed to skip upgrades](). Let's see if it pans out.
## 1.0.3
* Naval units' progression: I took a look at the wiki to make sure and, indeed, in vanilla Civ V, [Caravels only upgrade to Ironclads](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Caravel_(Civ5)) and [Privateers only upgrade to Destroyers](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Privateer_(Civ5)).  
I don't understand these breaks in military unit progression and, as I said below, they hamper my playstyle. So I removed them.
* Barbarians and Ironclads: as poor as they may be, modern-day pirates don't use wooden sailing ships. This, IMO, gets especially weird in Future Expansion, which introduces several advanced Barbarian units, such as the Outlaw and the Hit Squad.   
I believe Ironclads are a decent temporary stand-in for the refurbished, thrown-together steel ships some pirates use today. I do plan on introducing an exclusive unit for them, when I get the time.
## 1.0.2
I get the easter egg idea of some of the mod's advanced units, buildings etc., but I get very frustrated when I need to see some details of something in Civilopedia and can't find it. ðŸ«¤
## 1.0.1
See [the foreword to the 4.1.3 release of my reupload](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued/blob/main/docs/forewords.md#413) for more details.
## 1.0
* Solar Plants: I've no idea what Sullien [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/Sullien) has against them, but I like them, so they're back. ðŸ˜ƒ
* I made Drones faster than Observation Balloons, to better match their IRL speed.
* Military units' upgrades: I try to preserve my military units and strengthen them with promotions over time, so the breaks in their upgrade trees hurt my playstyle.  
I'm fairly sure I've connected the units correctly, according to their progression of strength and abilities, but, please tell me if I missed something.
* Uniques and promotions:
    * In addition to their roles of enhancing Siege units, Intel units are now very powerful for exploration, opening up the possibility of revealing the entire map much earlier than Satellites and rewarding players who spend effort on exploration.
    * Hovering units are now much more powerful â€“ more in line with their futurism/sci-fi counterparts â€“, capable of great autonomy and maneuverability.
    * Similarly, all flying and orbital units not of the Air Movement Type now have maneuverability that completely ignores what's below them.
    * Orbital Carriers and any units I may be able to implement later that are in space should be able to pass through everything, since their place on the map is merely a projection of their actual position.
